## Overview

Go supports UTF-8 characters out of the box without any special setup, libraries or packages.

```go
a := "Hello, 世界"
```

### History of Unicode

- In the past there was only one character set known as `ASCII` or the _American Standard Code for Information
  Interchange_ available.
- Here we use `7` bits to represent `128` characters, including upper and lowercase English letters, digits, and a
  variety of punctuations and device-control characters.
- Due to those limitations most of the population of the world is not able to use their own writing system on the
  computer.
- To solve this problem `Unicode` was invented. It is a superset of `ASCII` and contains all the characters present in
  the world’s writing system including accents and other diacritical marks, control codes like tab and carriage return,
  and assigns each of them a standard number called a `Unicode code point`
- In Go this is referred to as a `rune`. The `rune` type is an alias of `int32`.

## Runes

A `rune` is a special type in Go that represents special characters.

- You can define a `rune` using the single quote `'` character:

```go
a := 'A'
fmt.Println(a)
```

- If you run the program, it prints out the value of `65`.
- The reason is that runes in Go are a special type.
- As mentioned earlier a `rune` is an alias for `int32` which can be made up of 1 to 3 `int32` values.


- In many languages, the correct way to iterate over a string would look very much like the following:

```go
s := "Hello, 世界" // 9 characters (including the space and comma)
for i := 0; i < len(a); i++ {
fmt.Printf("%d: %s\n", i, string(s[i]))
}
```

[Run Code](https://play.golang.org/p/DGWCQ1CBq1m)

- Unfortunately the output would be the following:

```
0: H
1: e
2: l
3: l
4: o
5: ,
6:  
7: ä
8: ¸
9: 
10: ç
11: 
12: 
```

- Notice the unexpected characters that were printed out for index 7-12? This is because we are printing only a part of
  the `rune` as an `int32`, not the entire set of `int32`'s that make up the `rune`.
- The proper way to avoid this pitfall is to use the `range` keyword when looping through each character of the string:

```go
s := "Hello, 世界"
for i, c := range s {
fmt.Printf("%d: %s\n", i, string(c))
}
```

[Run Code](https://play.golang.org/p/A0kEtEBhKOM)

- The correct output would be the following:

```
0: H
1: e
2: l
3: l
4: o
5: ,
6:  
7: 世
10: 界
```

__NOTE__

> `range` ensures that we use the proper index and length of `int32`'s to capture the proper `rune` value.
